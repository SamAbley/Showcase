**If you want to view the output of this poject then go to [SOC](http://ec2-3-8-195-243.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/SOC/)**

This project is a web app that utilizes the cloud. This web app allows users to sign up and share images and interact with each other. Amazon Web Services provides cloud services that the app uses. The app is hosted on an EC2 cloud server and can be accessed through the URL/link provided. 
Other cloud services include:
 - RDS for database storage
 - S3 for file storage 
 - CloudFront for data privacy 
 - Rekognition for machine learning

Files that include components like security keys for AWS and Google have been removed to stop any security threats. This means that the files will not work on a local server if downloaded. These files have been included so that the working of the app can be viewed. 

All code was written and belongs to Sam Abley
