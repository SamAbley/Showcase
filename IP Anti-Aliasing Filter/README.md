# Anti-Aliasing/ Low Pass Filter
Impressionist painting anti-aliasing/ low pass filter is a Java desktop app. It can be accessed through the **["Anti-Aliasing filter.jar"](https://github.com/SamAbley/Showcase/blob/master/IP%20Anti-Aliasing%20Filter/Anti-Aliasing%20Filter.jar)**. This app takes impressionist paintings and applies a blur to them to show the overall detail and remove any Moire effect from the photo having to much detail. This subject was unknown by any of the team members so the client was heavily involved in the process. The output is a processed photo and an optional video of the process.
