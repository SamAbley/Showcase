## SOC: Sharing Over The Cloud
This is a full-stack web app that is currently live and can be accessed via this link **[SOC](http://ec2-3-8-195-243.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/SOC/)**. It integrates many cloud API's from Amazons web services and was written from scratch with no use of any templates. Users can sign up and start sharing images as they please.  There is security in place to stop threats like bots and spam accounts from flooding the app. To stop users from flooding the app with images that are NSFW, machine learning techniques are used to analyse images to check for any inappropriate images.

There are sign up restrictions in place to stop bots and spam accounts from attacking the app.  There are also image restrictions that use machine learning to stop any images that are NSFW from being shared

## CrossPlay ball Game
This is a socket server app that communicated across languages. It uses Java and C# clients and servers. Any client can connect to any server regardless of the language it was written in. I had zero prior knowledge of C# before starting this and in the end, the C# programs were on par with the Java versions.
