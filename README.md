## SOC: Sharing Over The Cloud
This is a **full-stack web app** that is currently live and can be accessed via this link **[SOC](http://ec2-3-9-176-86.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/SOC/)**. It integrates many cloud API's from **Amazons web services** and was written from scratch with no use of any templates. Users can sign up and start sharing images as they please.  There is security in place to stop threats like bots and spam accounts from crashing the app. To stop users from flooding the app with images that are NSFW, **machine learning techniques** are used to analyse images to check for any inappropriate images and block them automatically.

## IP Anti-Aliasing/ Low Pass Filter
This is a **desktop app written in Java**. The project was left field, with **no prior knowledge of the content**, the client had to work closely with the team to make sure it was done correctly. The app uses **post proccessing to blur photos** to eliminate the problem of Moire (rainbow effect caused by to much of detail). The output is a blurred photo and an optional video of the proccess.
